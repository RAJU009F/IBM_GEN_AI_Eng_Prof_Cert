    "## Introduction\n",
    "As a machine learning engineer hired by a social media company, your task is determining whether songs shared on the platform are appropriate for children. Given the high costs associated with processing each song using large language models (LLMs) for content evaluation, an alternative method using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is proposed. RAG combines the benefits of a retriever model, which fetches relevant information (in this case, embeddings of pre-answered content appropriateness questions), and a generator model, which uses this information to predict the appropriateness of new content. This approach efficiently scales the evaluation process while ensuring that each song's content is scrutinized for child safety without the overhead of running a full LLM for each song.\n",

    "\n",
    "In many machine learning and natural language processing tasks, measuring the similarity between vectors is crucial. While the dot product is a common measure, it considers both the magnitude and direction of the vectors. In contrast, **cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a similarity value that purely reflects their orientation in space regardless of their magnitude. This makes cosine similarity particularly useful in text processing where only the directionality of the vectors (i.e., the orientation of the words in the vector space) matters, not their length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to modify the `RAG_QA()` function, which currently uses the dot product to find the most relevant responses to a given query. You will replace the dot product with cosine similarity to improve the function's ability to determine response relevance based solely on the direction of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task description\n",
    "1. **Modify the function**: Replace the dot product calculation in the `RAG_QA()` function with cosine similarity. Remember, cosine similarity is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{Cosine Similarity} = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}}{\\|\\mathbf{A}\\| \\|\\mathbf{B}\\|}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ is the dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$,\n",
    "   - $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|$ and $\\|\\mathbf{B}\\|$ are the norms (or magnitudes) of vectors $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate norms**: Compute the norms of the question embeddings and the response embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute cosine similarity**: Adjust the computation of similarity by dividing the dot product by the product of the norms of the question and response embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sort and select responses**: After computing the cosine similarities, sort the responses based on these values and select the top responses as done currently with the dot product.\n"
