    "As a machine learning engineer working for a streaming site, your objective is to develop a recommender system based on written movie reviews. Given that the dataset for these reviews is relatively small, your strategy leverages a larger, accessible dataset of magazine articles. The plan is to pretrain the model on this expansive magazine dataset to capture a broad understanding of text and language patterns. Subsequently, the model will undergo fine-tuning on the smaller, specific dataset of movie reviews to adapt its learned features to the particular task of recommending movies.\n",

    "Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in several ways, each with its advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training the model on the small movie dataset:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Directly training on the movie review data ensures that the model is highly specialized and tailored to the specific characteristics and nuances of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Due to the small size of the dataset, the model is at a higher risk of overfitting. There might not be enough data to effectively capture all of the complexities of language and sentiment in movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pretraining the model on a larger general-domain text and fine-tuning the movie dataset for each parameter:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** This approach allows every part of the model to learn from the movie reviews, potentially improving its accuracy on the specific task.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Fine-tuning all parameters with a small dataset can still lead to overfitting. It also requires huge computational resources and time, as adjustments across all parameters might lead to numerous iterations of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning on the final layer only:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Fine-tuning only the final layer reduces the risk of overfitting, as the bulk of the model retains its pretrained structure. This method is faster and less resource-intensive.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Because only the final layer is adjusted, the model might not fully adapt to the specifics of the movie reviews, potentially limiting its effectiveness in understanding deeper contextual nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method offers a balance between adapting to the specifics of the movie review dataset and maintaining the robustness and generalizability learned from the larger magazine article dataset. Choosing the right strategy depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as available computational resources, the urgency of deployment, and the desired accuracy and specificity of the recommender system.\n"

    "The **IMDB dataset** contains movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and is commonly used for binary sentiment classification tasks. It's a popular dataset for training and testing models in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the context of sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reviews**: The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, divided evenly into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples.\n",
    "- **Sentiment labels**: Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, indicating the sentiment expressed in the review. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews in both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Text content**: Reviews are presented as plain text and have been preprocessed to some extent. For example, HTML tags are removed, but the text retains its original punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The dataset is commonly used to train models for binary sentiment classification, where the goal is to predict whether a given review is positive or negative based on its text content.\n",

Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.<br /><br />'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.<br /><br />It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.<br /><br />All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.\")\n",
      "(0, 'German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he\\'s unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer\\'s budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint \"Precinct 707\" on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn\\'t afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he\\'s the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don\\'t ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel\\'s logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We\\'re talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies, Lommel\\'s girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I won\\'t spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it\\'s perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.')\n",

For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am being exposed to a sequel.<br /><br />The premise itself is beyond absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exists. I can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I'm willing to suspend my belief.<br /><br />HOWEVER, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants. Being a member of the United States Army, I can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad.<br /><br />A squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives. That's just the way it works. Squad movements, vastly superior firepower, and of course, radio support, would ensure nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you wouldn't have casualties, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would take precedence, no-one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom.<br /><br />And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger, they would radio in for backup. And believe me, their radios would not be jammed, if there was a chance that normal radios would not do, the squad would have a military issue satellite phone. Chances are, if they were unable to check in every hour, a search would be called.<br /><br />In order to accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with.<br /><br />With the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine, the film fails to deliver. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats.<br /><br />As a combat veteran, I find the movie insulting.\")\n",

And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort.

This time moreover Scarlett\\'s not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star. She\\'s morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed. Sid and Sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. They simply team up, more or less politely, to carry out Strombel\\'s wishes by befriending Lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt. With only minimal protests Sid consents to appear as Sondra\\'s dad. Sondra, who\\'s captivated Peter by pretending to drown in his club pool, re-christens herself Jade Spence. Mr. Spence, i.e., Woody, keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks, but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker, spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining, apparently with success, that he\\'s in oil and precious metals, just as \"Jade\" has told him to say.<br /><br />That\\'s about all there is to it, or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome. At first Allen\\'s decision to make Johansson a gauche, naively plainspoken, and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision. But Johansson, who has pluck and panache as an actress, miraculously manages to carry it off, helped by Jackman, an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable, if he desires her. The film actually creates a sense of relationships, to make up for it limited range of characters: Sid and Sondra spar in a friendly way, and Peter and Sondra have a believable attraction even though it\\'s artificial and tainted (she is, after all, going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac).<br /><br />What palls a bit is Allen\\'s again drooling over English wealth and class, things his Brooklyn background seems to have left him, despite all his celebrity, with a irresistible hankering for. Jackman is an impressive fellow, glamorous and dashing. His parents were English. But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia (\"X-Man\\'s\" Wolverine) really pass as an aristocrat? Only in the movies, perhaps (here and in \"Kate and Leopold\").<br /><br />This isn\\'t as strong a film as \"Match Point,\" but to say it\\'s a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. It has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a TV show, but Woody\\'s jokes are far funnier and more original than you\\'ll get in any such media affair, and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. It doesn\\'t matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it\\'s diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you don\\'t want a heavy meal. The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded \"Match Point.\" Don\\'t believe them. He doesn\\'t try too hard. Why should he? He may be 70, but verbally, he\\'s still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.')\n",

      "(1, 'MGM were unsure of how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in \"Torrent\" justified that. She did not speak a word of English so she must have found it difficult to work, also Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her.<br /><br />The torrent of the title is the river Juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love but he is under his mother\\'s thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage. Meanwhile Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) has evicted Leonora\\'s parents from their home and they send Leonora to Paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Rafael, urging him to remember his promise and come with her. His mother is enraged and forbids him to go - so of course he caves in to her request.<br /><br />Years pass. Leonora has a new identity - she has become La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael has turned out just as his mother wished - he is running for office and is courting a \"safe\" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead) who is a \"hog\" heiress. Mack Swain plays her father. Leonora decides to visit her old home, and I agree - why hasn\\'t she helped her mother out. Her mother is still living at the family home, working as a skivvy and taking in washing. Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so enchantingly beautiful, it is hard to believe that he could be happy with Remedios.<br /><br />The dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town. Leonora\\'s house is in the path of the raging river but when Rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe. They then re-kindle their romance. There is a \"horizontal\" love scene in this film, very similar to the one in \"Flesh and the Devil\".<br /><br />Dona Brull goes spreading gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora\\'s mother believes her and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before she is about to tour America. Again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down. He spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation - \"what will she do for you but drag you down\". The irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her. They meet again, years later - she is as fresh and vibrant as ever - he looks older than his years, bowed down by mediocrity.<br /><br />It is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.<br /><br />Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupido, the barber and Leonora\\'s old and faithful friend.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.')\n",
      "(1, 'In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . Guess what happens next ? That`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues .<br /><br />But there`s one or two things that seem untypical . Ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he`s rude , and not only to Stan look at the way he addresses the servant with \" HEY YOU \" and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being \" I have nothing to say \" . In short Ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and I much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniest<br /><br />DIRTY WORK also lacks the reportary regulars of the other L&H shorts like Finlayson , Long , Busch and Housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie <br /><br />Having said that this is still a good short mainly down to Stan . Also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . Many jokes/plots from L&H feature fish and this is another one')\n",

      "(1, 'I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /><br />I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary. It did what it set out to do, show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the \"Balls\" was just spectacular to me. These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The catty folks, the complainers (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing wasn\\'t a man\\'s coat!), the jealous, it\\'s all there like in every other competition. LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it. Which I felt was a point.<br /><br />You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls \"used\" to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was that important to them! Then there was sad stories, stories of who\\'s \"house\" and \"house mother\" brought out the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting.<br /><br />Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film, I lived through the so called \\'Madonna\\' craze. I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her \"Vogue\" phase and rightfully so. If not for those individuals, Madonna wouldn\\'t have HAD a \"Vogue\" phase, I know that now. Credit should be given where credit is DUE. Makes me wonder, if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary, they\\'ll learn they\\'re not as \"mainstream\" as they think.')\n",

    "This model demonstrated notable improvement, exhibiting a remarkable achievement with an accuracy of 86% on the test data. This is higher than the 83% achieved by the model trained from scratch on the IMDB dataset. Although the training process was time-intensive (in fact, the fine-tuning was as time-intensive as training the model from scratch), the enhanced performance underscores the fine-tuned model's effectiveness and superiority over the model trained from scratch. A substantial portion of the computational effort was devoted to updating the transformer layers. To expedite the training process, one viable strategy is to focus on training the final layer only, which can significantly reduce the computational load but might compromise the model's accuracy.\n"
